# Python standard library only - no external dependencies required!
# All modules used are part of Python's standard library:
# - socket
# - threading
# - tkinter (for GUI client)
# - os
# - sys
# - argparse
# - json
# - datetime

# Note: Tkinter is included with standard Python installations
# If tkinter is not available (rare), you can still use the console client
